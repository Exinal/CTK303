  <p>I wanted to include this song because this is one of my favorite songs and it came out on the exact day of my birthday. This song is sung by one of my favorite singers, Hoshimachi Suisei and this song was one of the first big collaborations between a famous producer and a Vtuber. The collaboration was so successful that they went on to create a group called Midnight Grand Orchestra and create many more songs, even to this day.</p>
