    <p>Only Lonely Glory - BUMP OF CHICKEN</p>
</nav>
<main>
  <p>Only Lonely Glory is the eighth single by the alternative rock group BUMP OF CHICKEN. The reason I chose this song out of the few that were number 1 on the Japanese charts is that I have listened to a few of BUMP OF CHICKEN songs before and I wanted to do a Japanese song as most of the music I listen to is Japanese</p>
